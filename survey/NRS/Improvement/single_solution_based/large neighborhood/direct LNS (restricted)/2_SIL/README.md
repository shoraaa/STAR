This repository contains the code implementation of paper [Boosting Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Large-Scale Vehicle Routing Problems](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TbTJJNjumY). In this paper, we propose a lightweight cross-attention mechanism with linear complexity, by which a Transformer network is developed to learn efficient and favorable solutions for large-scale VRPs. We also propose a Self-Improved Training (SIT) algorithm that enables direct model training on large-scale VRP instances, bypassing extensive computational overhead for attaining labels. 

### 1. Dependencies
```bash
Python=3.8.6

```

### 3. Implementation

#### Testing
Run `Test_All\test.py` and `Test_All\test_PRC.py` to test the model using `greedy search` and `parallel random reconstruction`, respectively.

#### Training

To train the model, run `Train\Train.train.py`. This file contains parameters you can modify. Some instructions on the training process are provided.
